# About Me

I am Mohamed Boutuil (Da-ghost42), a passionate software engineering student at 1337 (42 Network) focused on systems programming, backend engineering, and clean, resilient architecture. Through the 42 curriculum I have built low-level C projects (memory management, parsing, process control, signals), networking services (IRC server), containerized infrastructures (Inception with Docker, Nginx, databases, monitoring), real‑time multiplayer web apps (ft_transcendence), rendering engines (cub3D raycaster, fract-ol fractal explorer), algorithmic tools (push_swap), and a Unix-like shell (minishell). I enjoy designing efficient abstractions, debugging tricky edge cases, and delivering maintainable code. My toolkit includes C, C++, Python, Django/DRF, React + Vite, Docker, shell scripting, and foundational DevOps practices. I value curiosity, iteration, and craftsmanship—always aiming to understand how things work under the hood while building useful, performant software. Feel free to reach out: mboutuil@gmail.com.
